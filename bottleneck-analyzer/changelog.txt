---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.6
  Features:
    - Added "Max Samples Per Recipe" setting (20-1000, default 100) to control ring buffer size and save file size
  Gui:
    - Replaced sample count label with a yellow low-data warning that appears when less than 5 minutes of data has been collected
    - Low-data warning includes a tooltip explaining what it means and what to do
    - Removed 1m time slice (too few samples at default sample rate to be useful)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.5
  Optimizations:
    - Status caching: skip entity.status calls on machines that were working last sweep (10% recheck rate, ~10% CPU reduction)
    - Fisher-Yates shuffle on entity list for more even per-tick workload distribution
  Bugfixes:
    - Re-enabled building recipe filter (recipes that produce placeable items are excluded from results)
  Changes:
    - Stripped all profiling/debug overhead from production code
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.1
  Bugfixes:
    - Reduced save file size by removing redundant cached data from storage
    - GUI layout and display fixes
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.0
  Optimizations:
    - Chunked per-tick sampling: work is spread across ticks so each tick only processes a small batch instead of all machines at once
    - Recipe cache to avoid repeated prototype lookups
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.0
  Features:
    - Added /bottleneck-dump command to export recipe data as JSON
    - Added /bottleneck-status command for tracking diagnostics
    - Added /bottleneck-reset command to clear sample data
  Optimizations:
    - Fixed major performance issue with large factories
  Gui:
    - Ingredients sorted by severity (highest bottleneck first)
    - Scrollable recipe area for recipes with many ingredients
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.3
  Features:
    - Keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+B) to toggle GUI
    - Esc to close window
    - Clickable fluid ingredients for drill-down navigation
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed focus steal when GUI opens
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.2
  Gui:
    - Sort ingredients by severity
    - Scrollable recipe area
  Changes:
    - Removed top bottlenecks panel (redundant with per-recipe view)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.1
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed item selector blanking when switching items
    - Fixed signal type parsing for fluids
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.0
  Major Features:
    - Initial release
    - Per-ingredient bottleneck percentages
    - Time-slice filtering (1m, 5m, 10m, 30m, 1h, all)
    - Multi-recipe tabbed views
    - Click-through ingredient navigation with back button
    - Color-coded bars (green/yellow/red)
    - Configurable sample rate (0.1s to 300s)
    - Ring buffer capped at 100 samples per recipe
  Compatibility:
    - Works with assembling machines, furnaces, and modded crafting entities
